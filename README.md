IDGZ.py

IDGZ is a parameter I came up with called the "Integrated Dendritic Growth Zone". It
is equal to relative humidity multiplied by omega (vertical velocity in pressure
coordinates), integrated from the bottom of the DGZ at -12 C to the top of the DGZ
at -17 C. It is meant to be used as a quick way to determine where favorabe 
conditions for dendrite growth exist. IDGZ is maximized where the depth of the DGZ,
ascent within the DGZ, and/or relative humidity within the DGZ are largest.
